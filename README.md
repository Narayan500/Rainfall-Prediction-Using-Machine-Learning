# Rainfall-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
📌 Rainfall Prediction Using Machine Learning

Description:
This project utilizes a Random Forest Classifier to predict rainfall based on historical weather data. It includes data preprocessing, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning to enhance model accuracy. Class imbalance is handled using SMOTE, and performance is evaluated with various metrics.

Tech Stack:
🔹 Python | Pandas | Scikit-Learn | Random Forest | SMOTE | Data Preprocessing

🔗 How to Use:
1️⃣ Load the dataset
2️⃣ Preprocess the data (handle missing values, encode categorical features)
3️⃣ Train the model using Random Forest
4️⃣ Evaluate performance with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

🚀 Future Improvements:

    Experiment with other machine learning models (XGBoost, Gradient Boosting)
    Optimize hyperparameters further using GridSearchCV
